          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>
            At the beginning of my UI/UX course, we learned about different methods of
            gathering research about user experiences. For this project, we were to choose
            an interface that could be improved and observe users in order to develop
            personas and a storyboard around that interface.
          </p>
          <h4>Context</h4>
          <p>
            I chose to observe people's interactions with a microwave in my home because
            it's a commonly used item and has a relatively complex interface. The
            following image is a sketch of its controls with a few notes.
          </p>
          <div class="img-container">
            <img
              src="assets/personas/microwave_sketch.png"
              width="70%"
              class="img-thumbnail"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            As shown above, the interface provides various ways to use and control the
            microwave. The key components involve a start/pause and a clear/off button,
            along with various other buttons for different modes, such as “popcorn” and
            “defrost”.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>Observations and Research</h4>
          <p>After observing 3 people use the microwave, I've noticed:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Users A and B only use the ‘time cook’ function. User C also used ‘defrost’
              and ‘reheat’, but took longer to decide.
            </li>
            <li>
              The majority of microwave usage was between 30 seconds and 3 minutes. There
              were few instances of microwave times greater than 5 minutes, primarily by
              user C.
            </li>
            <li>
              User A double presses the circular wheel to start, while users B and C press
              the circular wheel and then the ‘start’ button. User A is noticeably a lot
              faster at starting the microwave, while the other two seem to struggle a bit
              with selecting a specific amount of time.
            </li>
            <li>Users A and B tend to stop the microwave early.</li>
            <li>
              Most of the items microwaved were leftovers: mainly rice and side dishes.
              User C defrosted shrimp, while User A made a bowl of ramen and some popcorn.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Then, I asked my 3 users the following questions with the following summarized
            responses:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Are you in a time crunch?</li>
            There was only one instance were the user was using the microwave with a
            strict time crunch, and it was because user A had a Zoom meeting.
            <li>How essential is the food that you're microwaving?</li>
            Most instances were for
            <b>meals</b>
            (lunch and dinner), and user A described a few non-essential uses like warming
            up a cookie and melting butter for a dessert.
            <li>Is there another device you could use instead?</li>
            Answers involved using the stove and a pot or pan, but users A and B
            emphasized that it would
            <b>take longer</b>
            and involve more dishes to wash.
            <li>What’s going to happen to the item you put in?</li>
            Most of the answers involved wanting to
            <b>heat up</b>
            some kind of food item.
            <li>Are there any buttons you don’t need?</li>
            We noticed that no one used the ‘convection bake’, ‘convection roast’, or
            ‘combination fast bake’ buttons on the right of the wheel. ‘Micro express’ was
            a mystery that came up a few times, and in fact, only user C expressed that
            they use multiple different buttons.
          </ol>
          <br />
          <h4>Empathy Maps</h4>
          <p>
            Using the data collected during my observations and interviews, I constructed
            2 personas with empathy maps that describe what they think, feel, say, and do.
          </p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="images col-md-6">
              <img src="assets/personas/jason_empathy.png" class="img-fluid" />
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <p>
                The first persona I constructed was Jason. Jason is the parent of a
                college-aged kid, nearing his 60s. His wife goes to work during the day,
                but since he works from home, he now has to do a lot more cooking. He’s
                definitely more experienced with using more traditional means of cooking
                and heating food as he’s not well-versed in navigating the microwave’s
                interface.
              </p>
              <p>
                He struggles with the microwave interface because of the overwhelming
                number of choices and finds the wheel in the middle confusing to use.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jason represents the older users of the microwave interface and those who
                tend to incorporate the microwave as a part of the cooking process,
                instead of solely relying on it. These users may have more varied uses for
                the microwave, such as defrosting ingredients and boiling water.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <br />
          <div class="row">
            <div class="images col-md-6">
              <img src="assets/personas/jenny_empathy.png" class="img-fluid" />
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <p>
                The second persona I constructed was Jenny. Jenny is a college-aged
                student taking classes full-time and involved with quite a few clubs. She
                doesn’t really enjoy cooking.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jenny primarily uses the microwaves to prepare meals quickly, such as
                frozen dumplings from Trader Joe’s. Her main problem with the current
                interface is that she only really ever uses the ‘time cook’ function, but
                it’s quite inconvenient for longer amounts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jenny represents the younger users that enjoy and are accustomed to
                microwaveable foods. A lot of people, like Jenny, tend to use the
                microwave because they want to be quick and efficient. These types of
                users want to streamline the process and get to their desired result as
                easily as possible.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <br />

          <h4>Storyboard</h4>
          <p>
            Finally, using Jenny as the main persona, I created the following storyboard
            that provides context and shows how she would interact with the microwave:
          </p>
          <img src="assets/personas/storyboard.png" width="90%" class="img-thumbnail" />
          <br />
          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>
            This project allowed me to practice collecting observations and showed me how
            difficult it was to create good interview questions. In particular, it was
            hard to ask unbiased questions that revealed deeper insights.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general, I've learned that it's really important to consider the different
            contexts in which people use a specific interface and think about how a
            person's background influences their interactions. This project allowed me to
            get a better understanding of a user's mental model, become more empathetic,
            and think about how specific improvements would improve a person's experience.
